/**
 * For this Java practice assignment, we will just have you program in the main method of your program.  
 * 
 * There are the six mini-programs we want you to code.  All of the code you write should be in the main method of the HelloWorld 
 * class in the “HelloWorld.java” file.
 * 
 * The main method has been defined for you, but without the code. See the comments for each mini-program for instructions on what 
 * each part is supposed to do and how to write the code. It should be clear enough.  In some cases, we have provided hints to help 
 * you get started.
 *  
 * Note: DO NOT skip any of the mini-programs or the automated testing will fail.
